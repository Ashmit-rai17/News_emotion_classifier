# News Emotion Classifier 📰🤖

> **Hackathon Project**: Real-time emotion analysis of news headlines using machine learning to support data-driven decision making.

**Challenge Source**: https://unstop.com/p/breach-2025-a-fintech-hackathon-anirveda-the-technoeconomics-club-pdeu-1406470

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In today's information-saturated world, **thousands of news headlines** flood the internet every hour. For traders, businesses, and policymakers, understanding the emotional tone of news is critical but challenging:

- **Information overload** makes manual sentiment tracking impossible
- Human bias leads to inconsistent emotional interpretation  
- Delayed sentiment analysis results in **missed opportunities** in trading and risk assessment

**My Solution**: Automated real-time emotion classification system using NLP and machine learning to process news headlines and extract actionable emotional insights.

## Features

- 📊 **Real-time Analysis**: Processes live news feeds from multiple sources
- 🧠 **Multi-emotion Classification**: Identifies positive, negative, fear, optimism, anger, and more
- 🔄 **Automated Pipeline**: End-to-end processing from scraping to classification
- 📈 **Integration Ready**: Structured output for trading systems and dashboards
- 🎯 **Domain Agnostic**: Works across finance, politics, and general news

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+** - Core programming language
- **scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **NLTK/spaCy** - Natural language processing
- **BeautifulSoup** - Web scraping
- **pandas** - Data manipulation
- **matplotlib/seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Flask** - Web interface (if applicable)
